## Digital text analysis: a look at the toolbox 

Having read [the NYT piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/12/style/self-care/social-media-.html) about social media text analysis, and perhaps from your own life in this digital world of ours!!, you have at least head about some of the methods that a "computational sociolinguist" or a "digital humanist" might apply to text. 

### Sentiment analysis

#### "Positive" versus "negative" words

![Sentiment analysis: n pos v. n neg per text.](sa1.png)

![Sentiment analysis: comparing pos:neg ratios.](sa2.png)

![Sentiment analysis: split each text into 100 slices, then track sentiment curve.](sa3.png)

![Sentiment analysis: same as above, but with act boundaries marked.](sa4.png)

#### Tag for more than 2 emotions

### Tag for parts of speech

## Start by loading our data

First we'll get an inventory of all the .DOCX files in our project directory.

```{r}
(textfiles <- list.files(pattern = ".docx"))
```

The second file has more formatting and may, for the time being, be more useful. We'll read it in. Here is the top of its content.

```{r}
f <- read_docx(textfiles[2])
f %>% head(10)
```

Here it is, converted to tabular format.

```{r}
f <- 
  f %>% 
  enframe() %>% 
  select(line = 2) %>% 
  mutate(file = textfiles[2])
f %>% 
  head(10) %>% 
  kbl() %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", 
                full_width = F, 
                position = "left") 
```

## Narrowing down our interest

I have just received the latest notes from class: the interest seems to be in the difference between verse and prose *crossed with* an interest in character. I interpret this to mean that there are characters that appear both in verse and in prose sections, and we <mark>want to know how the language associated with each character differs from verse to prose.</mark>

In the text samples I have, character speech is not marked. We might be better off if we pull *Taming of the Shrew* from www.gutenberg.org.

Luckily there is an R module that interfaces with the Gutenberg archives. It is called `gutenbergr`. I will pull the whole text from there. 

```{r}
shakespeare <- 
  gutenberg_works(author == "Shakespeare, William") 

shakespeare                    %>% 
  mutate(entry = row_number()) %>% 
  select(entry, title)  %>% 
  kbl() %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", 
                full_width = F, 
                position = "left") 
```

So our text is there and available, at index no. 10. 

```{r}
IDs <-  shakespeare[c(10),]$gutenberg_id

shakespeare %>% 
  filter(gutenberg_id %in% IDs) %>% 
  select(gutenberg_id, title)
```

Let's download the play and store it in an R object. 

```{r}
plays <- gutenberg_download(IDs, meta_fields = "title")

plays %>% as_tibble()
```
